# BNS-Purple-Updater
 Same thing as the UE4 Patcher but for their new launcher / product called Purple.
 Currently only works for KR-LIVE Blade & Soul Client, test-server not yet supported and other regions have not transitioned to Purple and may never transition to Purple

 Because I had to do a significant amount of code rework I used mvvm pattern & dependency injection so things look a bit more complicated or cleaner compared to UE4-Patcher
